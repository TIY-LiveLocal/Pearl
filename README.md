## Facebook Graph API

The Graph API is named after the idea of a 'social graph' - a representation of the information on Facebook composed of:

- *nodes* - basically "things" such as a User, a Photo, a Page, a Comment
- *edges* - the connections between those "things", such as a Page's Photos, or a Photo's Comments
- *fields* - info about those "things", such as a person's birthday, or the name of a Page

The Graph API is HTTP based, so it works with any language that has an HTTP library, such as cURL, urllib.


### Tokens

*User Access Token* - modify or write data on behalf of a user

*App Access Token* - modify and read app settings; also used to publish Open Graph actions.

*Page Access Token* - similar to user access tokens, but allow read andwrite on a Facebook page.

*Client Token* -  used to identify your app; isn't meant to be secretl; used to access app-level APIs, but only a very limited subset.

User access tokens come in two forms: short-lived tokens and long-lived tokens. Short-lived tokens usually have a lifetime of about an hour or two, while long-lived tokens usually have a lifetime of about 60 days.

Access tokens generated via web login are short-lived tokens, but you can convert them to long-lived tokens by making a server-side API call along with your app secret.

Limitations
Some user data that would normally be visible to an app that's making a request with an user access token isn't always visible with an app access token. If you're reading user data and using it in your app, you should use a user access token instead of an app access token.
